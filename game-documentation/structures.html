<h1>Structures (Skins)</h1>
<p>Structures in SCP Architect X are used to create your facility. These are the <strong>walls</strong>, <strong>windows, doors, floors, roofs, and lights!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there are 4 skins available for use in SCP Architect X.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Architect</li>
  <li>Office</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Neo Pack<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Architect&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The <strong>Architect </strong>skin is the default skin available to everyone. It's minimalistic qualities make this a perfect skin that fits most use cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This skin contains sub-variants, such as half-walls and hanging lights.</p>

<h2>Office</h2>
<p>The <strong>Office</strong> skin is, as the name suggests, an office-themed structure. Despite it's name, this pack is very robust and it's brick texture allows it to fit into both containment use and personnel use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This skin contains sub-variants, such as half-walls and hanging lights.</p>

<h2>Maintenance&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The <strong>Maintenance</strong> skin is an industrial-themed structure that features tubes and electrical wires strung across it's walls. It's intended for maintenance-shaft and other similar zones, but is universal enough to be used in a plethora of ways and ideas.</p>
<p>This skin contains sub-variants, such as half-walls and walls w/ integrated lights.</p>

<h2>Neo Core</h2>
<p>The <strong>Neo Core skin </strong>is a futuristic and neon themed structure that features intricate details such as textured walls, neon lights, piping, unique floors, and unique rooves. This is the first skin to require purchase via Robux, which is deserving because it is also undoubtedly the most detailed skin in the game.</p>

<h1>Additional Structures</h1>
<p>Some structures are not tied to one Structure skin, instead you can use them from any structure skin. As of now, there is only one structure: the Blast Door. It must be unlocked through Foundation Research. The Blast Door is&nbsp;composed of grey simple and rough walls, complete with a very large split-door. It's very handy to separate sectors or different Structure Skins.</p>
