# Linking

**Linking** is a core concept in Architect X, that defines how a specific object or piece of furniture will function in your tycoon. In order to have furnishing objects such as tables, chairs, beds, and desks work for your personnel, some must be linked to specific objects to allow for personnel to use it. You can link as many furnishings as you need to each other and clicking the same furnishing you clicked will instead un-link the object.

## Creating a Link

When placing an object, one of three things will happen.

1\. Nothing will happen. Instead, this becomes a link-to object. This object can be classified as a “host” object because many other objects can link to it.

2\. An error pop-up will appear. When this happens, you have to link it to a “host" object for it to function. This object can be classified as a “Parasite” object because it requires a “host”.

3\. Nothing will happen, but this time linking to other items will not be possible. This object can be classified as an “isolate” object because it does not require linking nor can it link.

### 1\. ‘Host’ Objects

Currently, there are four host objects.

1\. The Kitchen Buffet, which can be linked into the cafeteria table.

2\. The Toilet, which can be linked into the old bed. The toilet may also be classified as an “Isolate” object.

3\. The Standard Desk, which can be linked into any safe or Euclid SCPs. The desk is important for your revenue as without one, SCPs can not be tested on.

4\. The Computer Desk, which can be linked into any safe or Euclid SCPs. This is the same as the Standard Desk. This item may also be classified as an “Isolate” object.

### 2\. 'Parasite' Objects

Currently, there are three parasite objects.

1.  The old bed, which links into the toilet. This is a requirement for Class D to be put into your facility.
2.  The cafeteria table, which links into the kitchen buffet. This is a requirement for personnel and Class Ds to fulfill their hunger needs.
3.  The SCPs, which links into the desk. Once again, this is important for your revenue for testing to occur.

### 3\. ‘Isolate’ Objects

There are currently five isolate objects.

1.  The bed. Personnel sleep in this bed, and as such it does not require linking to anywhere else.
2.  The toilet. Even though it could be linked to an old bed, it could also function without linking, leaving personnel to use it.
3.  The Computer Desk. Even though it could be linked to an SCP, personnel may use it after testing to yield higher earnings.
4.  The metal detector. This object is only for security measures and for now does not require linking.
5.  The elevator. This object is only to move personnel and class D at the moment and does not require linking.

## Trivia

The first version of linking was instead called “Zoning” which had objects placed inside zones, but the idea was scrapped.
