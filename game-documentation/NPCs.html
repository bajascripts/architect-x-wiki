<h1>NPCs</h1>
<p><strong>NPCs (non-player character)s</strong> in SCP Architect X serve many functions for your foundation.</p>
<p><strong>NPCs are meant to be predictable, and have limited random properties or decisions unless explicitly stated</strong>.</p>
<h2>Current NPCs</h2>
<p>This is a list of current NPCs within the game, their function, and cost to hire.</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>

<h2>NPC Metrics</h2>
<p>NPCs have 3 major metrics, <strong>Bathroom, Hunger, &amp; Energy.</strong></p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Metric</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Bathroom</td>
        <td>The bathroom metric shows the accessibility and use of toilets for NPCs.&nbsp;<br>To increase this metric, you should place more toilets across your facility.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hunger</td>
        <td>The hunger metric shows the accessibility and use of cafeteria tables for NPCs.<br>To increase this metric, you should place and link more cafeterias across your facility.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Energy</td>
        <td>The energy metric shows the amount of rest and use of beds for NPCs.<br>To increase this metric, ensure all staff and test subjects have a sufficient amount of beds.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<p>You view your overall NPC metrics by visiting the <a href="/en/game-documentation/foundation-management">Foundation Management</a> tab.</p>
<h2>NPC Prices</h2>
<p>The cost of hiring scientists and security grows exponentially as you hire.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>The base cost for scientists is <strong>$1000</strong></li>
  <li>The base cost for security is <strong>$1500</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Math</h3>
<p>The prices for NPC's are determined by this function</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/equation.png"></figure>
<p>whereâ€¦</p>
<p><strong>c</strong> is the base cost.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong> is the number of NPCs that you already have.</p>
<p>In this provided function, it's raising 1.4 to the number to NPCs you have, then multiplying it by the base cost followed by rounding it to a whole number.</p>
<p>The total cost of buying <strong>n </strong>NPCs:</p>

<h1>NPC Behavior</h1>
<p>Outlined below is the static behavior of every NPC. An NPC's lifecycle is a loop of actions and decisions an NPC will make during it's life time (from hiring to firing).</p>
<p>// for braden to do when behavior trees are implemented</p>
